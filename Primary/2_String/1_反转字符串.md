# 题目

Write a function that reverses a string.

The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.



# 示例

### Example 1:

```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```



### Example 2:

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```



# 算法





# 代码

```c

void reverseString(char* s, int sSize) {

    char temp;
    for(int i = 0; i < sSize/2; i++) {
        temp = s[i];
        s[i] = s[sSize - 1 -i];
        s[sSize -1 -i] = temp;
    }
}

```
