The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1. 1
2. 11
3. 21
4. 1211
5. 111221
```



`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.

`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.

`21` is read off as `"one 2` , then `one 1"` or `1211`.



Given an integer **n** where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in goups of the same digit.
