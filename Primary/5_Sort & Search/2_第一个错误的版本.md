# 题目

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.

Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1,2,....,n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.



# 示例

### Example:

```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version. 
```



# 算法



# 代码

```C++
// 【初级算法】排序和搜索 - 第一个错误的版本

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

// Forward declaration of isBadVersion API.
bool isBadVersion(int version);
 
class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        long mid, l, r;
        l = 1;r = n;
        mid = (l+r)>>1;
        while(l < r) {
            if(isBadVersion(mid)) r = mid;
            else l = mid+1;
            mid = (l+r)>>1;
        }
        return l;
    }
};

```
